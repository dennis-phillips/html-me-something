		<h2 id ="bold-center-text">The Ancient City</h2>
		<p>Rome was an amazing place to visit. I am a history buff and enjoy learning about cultures<br>
		and learning new languages. My trip to Rome "Roma" afforded me the opportunity to do <br> both. 
		I went to several historical ruins, visited the major landmarks including the Colliseum<br>pictured in the selfie above.<br></p>

	<p> Berlin was another amazing place I was fortunate enough to visit in my recent travels<br>
	what I liked best about Berlin besides it's fascinating history was it's vibrant culture.<br>
	Berlin is a melting-pot city. I especially like the former East Berlin areas. Like <i>Mauerpark</i>,<br>
	and <i>Kreuzberg</i>. I went to many soccer games in Berlin ranging from Bundesliga 1 games featuring Hertha BSC,<br>
	to Bundesliga 2 matches featuring FC Union Berlin, and Bundesliga regional team matches featuring BFC Dynamo.<br>
	Its safe to say I'm a huge soccer fan, especially German soccer!</p>

	<h2 class ="italic"> Lakeside Resort in the Southern Balkans, Key City in Slavic Language History</h2>
	<p> Ohrid is a small town located on Lake Ohrid in Macedonia. Lake Ohrid spans over parts of Macedonia and Albania.<br>
	Ohrid was an amazing place to visit, still very rustic and off the main tourist paths. The people were very friendly<br>
	and hospitable. I enjoyed touring the small byzantine style orthodox churches in Ohrid. I learned while I was there, that<br>
	the cyrillic aphabet was codified in Ohrid and the first missionaries to the Slavs actually departed from Ohrid. Old Church<br> Slavonic,
	the mother alphabet of all modern slavic languages, originated in this small town.</p>
